# ✈️ Jetdex

**Jetdex** is a structured, data-driven platform that indexes the world’s **fighter jet manufacturers, aircraft programs, and military aviation systems**.

It focuses on **who builds fighter jets**, how those aircraft are developed, and what distinguishes them — presented in a clean, scalable format suitable for **developers, researchers, and aviation enthusiasts**.

## 🎯 Purpose

Jetdex aims to solve this by providing:

- A **normalized, queryable dataset**
- Clear relationships between **countries, manufacturers, and aircraft**
- A foundation for **APIs, dashboards, and analytics**
- A **portfolio-grade system design project**
